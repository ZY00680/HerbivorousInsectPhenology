Effects of specific temperatures on A. gossypii development and survival are unknown and would be useful in helping interpret population dynamics and devising management tactics for this pest. In this paper, the effect of temperature on the life table of A. gossypii reared on cotton was evaluated under laboratory conditions using temperatures of 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 °C. The developmental rate of immatures increased exponentially from 18 to an optimum around 27 °C and then declined. The estimated lower developmental threshold was 8.0 °C, and 107.5 degree days were required for development from the first instar to adult. The percentage survival of immature stages varied from 81 to 91 % within the range of 18-27 °C. Survival declined to 27 % at 30 °C. The average longevity of adult females was 15.7, 11.7, 8.2, 5.2, and 2.8 days, and the average number of offspring produced per female was 46, 38, 20, 14, and 0, at temperatures of 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 °C, respectively. From 21-27 °C, the intrinsic rate of increase of A. gossypii was significantly higher than at 18 °C, indicating that 21–27 °C was within the optimal range for the growth of A. gossypii, and that 30 °C constant is beyond the upper limit for reproduction. The observations will form the basis of a forecasting system and could account for the decline of the species on cotton in central Asia as well as other regions during hot summer months.","Gao, G.

Three species (Adelphocoris suturalis, Adelphocoris fasciaticollis and Adelphocoris lineolatus) are found in Chinese Bt cotton fields, each with a distinct geographic distribution and phenology. In the present study, the development and fecundity of the three species are compared in the laboratory at various temperatures in the range 10–35 °C. Although nymphal development and adult moulting occurs under all temperature regimes, egg eclosion is not observed at 10 °C. In general, egg and nymphal development periods decrease with increasing temperature up to 30 °C. The lower and upper development thresholds are, respectively, 5.6 and 40.1 °C for A. suturalis eggs; 5.0 and 38.4 °C for nymphs; 6.3 and 39.0 °C for A. fasciaticollis eggs, 3.0 and 41.9 °C for nymphs; 5.6 and 41.3 °C for A. lineolatus eggs; and 6.2 and 38.8 °C for nymphs. Thermal constants are 189.9 degree days (DD) (egg) and 308.8 DD (nymph) for A. suturalis, 188.8 DD (egg) and 366.7 DD (nymph) for A. fasciaticollis, and 231.7 DD (egg) and 291.6 DD (nymph) for A. lineolatus. Temperatures above 30 °C affect egg development of A. fasciaticollis and A. lineolatus adversely, but not that of A. suturalis. At the same time, nymphal survival of A. suturalis is reduced at 10 °C. Longevity of all species declines with increasing temperature, whereas extremes of temperature (i.e. 10 and 35 °C) interfere with oviposition.

However, the seasonal phenology of moths varies between crop cultivars and years, making it difficult to schedule the control measures. Here, we monitored male flight activity of oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta and summer fruit tortrix moth Adoxophyes orana by using sex pheromone traps in peach orchards of three different cultivars for three successive years. We developed a logistic multiple-peaks model to fit data and then calculated degree-days (DD) required for male activity and neonate emergency. Results show that G. molesta and A. orana males had 4–5 and 3 flight peaks per year, respectively. The seasonal phenology of G. molesta or A. orana was quite stable with an identical timing of each flight peak between cultivars in a year. The flight activity was usually higher in the second and third peaks for both moths, with a higher cumulative number of G. molesta males captured than that of A. orana. Compared to A. orana, G. molesta emerged early in spring and required lower degree-days to reach the subsequent flight peaks and for neonate emergency. Our results suggest that to decline the possibility of outbreaks of moths during the growing seasons, pheromone traps should be scheduled in April with a cumulative DD between 49.6 and 207.1 for G. molesta and in mid-May–early June with a cumulative DD between 450.4 and 866.7 for A. orana, aiming to trap the newly emerged male adults or disrupting female mating success of overwintered moths in orchards. Based on the thermal requirement for egg hatching (i.e., 79.4 DD for G. molesta and 90.0 DD for A. orana), insecticide treatments would be applied in late-April–early May and late May–early June to reduce the field population density of neonates of G. molesta and A. orana, respectively, to reduce fruit damage in orchards. Furthermore, pheromone traps set up in late July–early August (573.8–1025.2 DD) for G. molesta and in mid-September (1539.7–1788.9 DD) for A. orana may suppress overwintering populations and thus decrease pest infestation in next year.","Ma, A., Zhang, H., Ran, H., et al.",2023,Prediction of seasonal population dynamics of Grapholita molesta (Busck) and Adoxophyes orana (Fischer von Röslerstamm) in peach orchards using sex pheromone trap and degree-days and its implications in pest management,Frontiers in Agronomy,5,1269977,Lepidoptera,Tortricidae,Adoxophyes,orana,18.75,Wingspan,Wingspan; Female:19-22; Male: 15-19,https://massnrc.org/pests/pestFAQsheets/summer%20fruit%20tortrix%20moth.htm,43,wood,N,Y,https://plantwiseplusknowledgebank.org/doi/full/10.1079/pwkb.species.11253,1,Included

Adult beetles reared at 23-27 deg C were heavier than those reared at 15-20 deg C and 30 deg C, and females were heavier than males. There was significant mortality of adults during exposure to low temperatures. Mortality was 92% for adults exposed for four weeks at 10 deg C and 70% for adults exposed for 12 weeks at 15 deg C. The number of eggs laid subsequently decreased as the time adults were exposed to chilling was increased. Viability decreased as the temperature to which adults were exposed was lowered, and with increased chilling time. Females survived longer than males when chilled at 10 deg and 15 deg C. All adults died when chilled for 13 h at -8 deg C; at 2 deg and -4 deg C there was high adult survival, but the viability of eggs laid was low.

Degree-day requirements were found broadly to explain the relative distributions and differences in voltinism of A. urticae, P. c-album and I. io. The migrant V. atalanta did not fit into the predicted pattern, and this species may be more limited by its ability to overwinter. Although the most northerly distributed species, A. urticae, had the lowest degree-day requirement, it had the highest developmental threshold and performed best (for mortality, pupal weight and relative growth rate) at high experimental temperatures. It is suggested that this may be due to the gregarious nature of its larvae and their possible ability to thermoregulate. At southern margins, different distributional limits may be explained partly by larval gregariousness (a more northern trait) and maximum temperatures at which development is possible. Limits to the distributions of these mobile species are at least partially explicable by the interaction of climatic patterns and thermal biology.

The larvae are polyphagous and the rate of larval development does not vary according to the different crops supplied, nor does the kind of soil influence the number of instars and the rate of development.

Early authors pointed to dry summers as the trigger; around 1980, the explanation was improved via modelling of historical data. The number of precipitation days and the July temperature proved to be important, and in experiments, moist soil caused considerable mortality. This information was used in preliminary forecasting with pheromone trap catches as biofix for estimations of occurrence and survival. As more precise information on temperature effects on growth and survival was needed, we performed experiments on growth and mortality effects on egg, all larval instars and pupae. We found clear positive relations between temperatures below 35 �C and development rates of eggs, all larval instars and pupae. Mortality was also affected, and low temperature caused pronounced mortality of young larvae. The severe mortality under cold, moist conditions versus high survival under warm, dry conditions may explain both the lack of relation between captures and injuries and the pronounced fluctuations of cutworm attacks in NW Europe reported from 1905 to present. These variations are likely to increase with the climate change and suggest a reanalysis of data on trap capture and injuries to improve decision support and sustainability in Integrated Pest Management.","Esbjerg, P. and Sigsgaard, L.",2019,Temperature dependent growth and mortality of Agrotis segetum,Insects,10.1,7,Lepidoptera,Noctuidae,Agrotis,segetum,33.5,Wingspan,Averaged:27-40,https://www.ukmoths.org.uk/species/agrotis-segetum,85,both,Y,Y,https://plantwiseplusknowledgebank.org/doi/full/10.1079/pwkb.species.3797#sec-4,1,Included

Based on the temperature effects detailed here, larval development and pupation should be possible in most of the continental United States where suitable hosts are available. These data can be used to develop a degree-day model to estimate beetle phenology; however, at least 2°C should be added to air temperatures to adjust for the mediation of temperature by the wood. These data provide a basis for predicting the potential geographical range of this species and for developing phenological models to predict the timing of immature stages, both of which are important for management programs.","Keena, M.

We used mass mark-recapture methods and observed that 98% of beetles were recaptured within 920 m from a release point, whereas the median dispersal rate for all recaptured adults was 30 m/d. Dispersal potential within the course of a season for males and gravid females was 2394 and 2644 m, respectively; however, more work is needed to evaluate the potential of long-distance dispersal events to initiate new colonies outside current U.S. quarantine boundary guidelines. We observed that Populus nigra var. thevestina tree size and number of existing emergence holes on a tree were significant positive predictors of new emergence holes, but we did not measure a significant effect of tree size, number of existing emergence holes, and number of new emergence holes on adult beetle abundance. Implications of these findings within the context of host quality are discussed, but more research is needed to identify key factors in the multiyear host colonization process.

Both the nymphs and adults attack all vegetative and fruiting parts of the coffee tree and reduce the yield up to 45%. In addition, they have been reported to be involved in the �potato taste� defect in Coffea arabica reducing its quality and competitiveness in foreign markets. Climatic factors such as temperature and humidity are primary factors that affect growth and development of insects. Therefore global warming may have a potential impact on the population dynamics of Antestia bugs and this may lead to an increase in crop losses. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of temperature and other agroecological and biological factors such as elevation and shade on the biology and ecology of A. orbitalis in order to contribute to a predictive model of the pest distribution and dynamics in East Africa. To achieve this objective three field observations were carried out at Mount Kilimanjaro, Moshi, Tanzania at six different elevations viz. 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500 and 1600 meters above sea level in 24 coffee farms. In these farms, the number of Antestia bugs was visually counted and recorded. The biology of A. orbitalis was studied at five constant temperatures of 18 �C, 20 �C, 25 �C, 30 �C and 32 �C with relative humidity 70 � 80 % and photoperiod 12:12 L:D. The results indicated that the density of Antestia bugs significantly increased with an increase in elevation (F = 6.28; P < 0.001; df = 5, 1074). The abundance of coffee fruit load (flower buds, young berries, fully developed berries and red ripe berries) had significant effect on the density of Antestia bugs (P < 0.001). In the laboratory study, the developmental time of A. orbitalis decreased significantly with an increase in temperature (P < 0.001). The oviposition period was longer at 20 �C with an average of 57.9 days compared to other temperatures. The gross reproductive rate (GRR) was higher at 20 �C with 48.03 daughters per female compared to 6.05 and 0.75 daughters per female at 25 �C and 30 �C respectively. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was ranged between 0.016 and -0.029 females/female/day at 20 �C and 30 �C respectively while the time required for population to double (Td) was markedly shorter at 20 �C,  xiii with 43.89 days compared to 25 �C, with 73.7 days. Linear and non-linear models were used to describe the relationship between temperature and the development rate of A. orbitalis. Temperature had a significant effect on development rate of A. orbitalis (egg, first, second and third nymph stages p < 0.05, df =1, 3). The minimum temperatures allowing development (To) were 12.9 �C, 12.9 �C, 13.7 �C, 9.9 �C, 4.4 �C and 2.9 �C for egg, first, second, third, fourth and fifth nymph stages respectively. However, the linear regression model cannot predict nonlinear relationship between temperature and development rate that exists at extreme temperatures. Therefore Logan type I model was used for the egg, first, second, third and fourth nymph stages while Hilbert and Logan 2 equation was fitted for fifth nymph stage. The mortality rate was calculated for each life stage using exponential polynomial functions. The highest mortality of immature stages was observed in second nymph stage with mortality rate of 94%, 70%, 27%, 61% and 90% at 18 �C, 20 �C, 25 �C, 30 �C, and 32 �C respectively. It can be concluded that the population density of Antestia bugs significantly depends on elevation and fruit load. Moreover, temperature has a significant effect on the development time, development rate, mortality rate of A. orbitalis as well as on fecundity and population growth. ","Ahmed, A.

Temperature-dependent models were developed using the Insect Life Cycle Modelling software (ILCYM) through a complete life table study at seven constant temperatures in the range 18�32 �C. Non-linear functions were fitted to A. thunbergii development, mortality, fecundity and senescence.

Therefore, the developmental biology and life history parameters of A. eugenii were characterized in the laboratory on Capsicum annuum ’Jalapeño’ fruits at seven constant temperatures ranging from 15 to 33°C. A. eugenii developed through three instars at all temperatures. Linear regression analysis estimated a lower developmental threshold of 9.6°C and a degree-day requirement of 256.4 for development from egg to adult. Fecundity increased with increasing temperatures to a maximum at 30°C but declined at 33°C. Net reproductive rate (Ro), intrinsic rate of increase (rm), and finite rate of increase (&lgr;) were greatest at 30&deg;C, whereas development time and mortality were least at this temperature regimen. Thus, 30&deg;C proved to be the optimal temperature for population increase because a maximum fecundity of 3.1 eggs/female/d, the shortest development time of 12.9 d, minimal mortality, and the highest life history parameters were obtained.

The size of non-growing stages (2nd moult and prepupa) decreased with increasing temperature. High temperatures also reduced the size of growing stages (2nd and 3rd instars) and therefore affected the period during which scales were vulnerable to A. melinus. High temperatures also reduced the proportion of the scale population available to A. melinus for female progeny production. When developing scales were exposed to variable temperatures, average temperature during the developmental period predicted the size of the 2nd moult and prepual stages.

The phenology and population characteristics of SBW were investigated in sugar beet fields in eastern Croatia over a 4-year period (2012–2015). By using the degree-day model (lower development threshold of 5°C, no upper development threshold, biofix 1 January), the first emergence of overwintering adults was determined as becoming established when the DDA reached 20. The adult emergence was completed when the DDA reached 428. SBW males emerged first, following which the females dominated the adult population. Overwintering adults were present in the field until early July. In August, adults of the offspring generation began to appear. The eggs laid by the overwintering generation required, on average, 10–15 days to develop into larvae; however, eggs were found in soil samples over a period of 102 days (between JDs 112 and 214). Larvae were present in the soil samples over a period of a maximum of 143 days (the first larvae were established on JD 122 and the last one on JD 265), and pupae were established in the soil over a period of 102 days (between JDs 143 and 245).

Lacking an integrated pest management strategy, growers have resorted to an intensive chemical control program that may be leading to insecticide-resistant B. cockerelli populations in south Texas and Mexico. To initiate the development of an integrated approach of controlling B. cockerelli , we used constant temperature studies, nonlinear and linear modeling, and field sampling data to determine and validate the degree day parameters for development of B. cockerelli infesting potato. Degree day model predictions for three different B. cockerelli life stages were tested against data collected from pesticide-free plots. The model was most accurate at predicting egg-to-egg and nymph-to-nymph peaks, with less accuracy in predicting adult-to-adult peaks. It is impractical to predict first occurrence of B. cockerelli in potato plantings as adults are present as soon cotyledons break through the soil. Therefore, we suggest integrating the degree day model into current B. cockerelli management practices using a two-phase method. Phase 1 occurs from potato planting through to the first peak in a B. cockerelli field population, which is managed using current practices. Phase 2 begins with the first B. cockerelli population peak and the degree day model is initiated to predict the subsequent population peaks, thus providing growers a tool to proactively manage this pest.","Lewis, O.

Its invasion into desert agriculture in California and Arizona presents a conundrum between rapid pest development at warm temperatures and severe damage to cool season crops. In this study, the development and survival of B. hilaris were determined at nine constant temperatures (ranging from 20–42°C) when reared on organically grown broccoli florets. Egg hatching was greatly delayed at 20°C, and first instar nymphs did not survive at this temperature. No eggs hatched at 42°C. The highest survival rates (70.0–86.7%) of B. hilaris were observed at temperatures ranging from 24 to 35°C. The total developmental rate of B. hilaris from egg to adult increased from 0.027 to 0.066/d from 24 to 35°C, and then slightly dropped to 0.064/d at 39°C. Based on the linear model, B. hilaris requires 285.4 degree-days to complete its development. The Briere 1 model predicted the lower and upper temperature thresholds as 16.7 and 42.7°C, respectively. The optimal temperature for development (TOpt) was estimated as 36°C. According to the results, B. hilaris is well adapted to warm conditions, and temperatures of 33–39°C are well suited for B. hilaris development. Information from this study helps explain the rapid range expansion of B. hilaris across the southern United States and will be instrumental in predicting future expansion across the rest of the country and in other parts of the world.

Adults of the overwintering generation became active when the temperature rose above 7 deg C, and immediately began to feed and mate. Overwintered females oviposited from the third week of April until the end of May, and those of the summer generation from the third week of July to the end of August. The fecundity of females averaged 15.6 eggs/female for the spring generation and 6.9 for the summer one. There were 5 nymphal instars, which are described. Some of the adults were macropters that migrated to other areas of turf. Second-generation nymphs completed their development in early October and the adults overwintered in the turfgrass thatch. The field population peak and mean numbers at each stage were correlated with temperature sums above 14.6 deg C, the threshold for egg development. Among natural enemies of the lygaeid were the parasite Eumicrosoma beneficum Gah., the fungus Beauveria bassiana and the predacious carabid Amara sp. Other factors affecting mortality at the egg stage were desiccation, failure to hatch, and mortality at eclosion caused by the wet condition or the thatch.

The results indicate that the species differ in the developmental rates, survival curves and cumulative hatching probabilities. The eggs of O. haemorrhoidalis had the fastest developmental rate with a low developmental threshold temperature of 9.9 degrees C and the sum of effective temperature (SET) 211.2 degree-days (DD). The corresponding values were 10.9 degrees C and 210.6 DD for C. abbreviatus, 10.5 degrees C and 240.2 DD for Ch. fallax respectively. The SET at which 50% of post-diapause eggs hatched were 252.0 DD for O. haemorrhoidalis, 262.8 DD for C. abbreviatus, and 273.3 DD for Ch. fallax. The predicted maximal hatch ability of O. haemorrhoidalis (91.17%), C. abbreviatus (75.67%) and Ch. fallax (94.07%) occurred at 23.7, 29.0 and 31.3 degrees C, respectively.

These results suggest that O. haemorrhoidalis adapt to hatch at a lower temperature range, C. abbreviatus adapt to mid-temperature range, while Ch. fallax adapt to hatch at a higher temperature range.

A minimum of 418 day-degrees was required for preimaginal development, and an additional 124 day-degrees for 95% oviposition. Parameters for two strains originating from Switzerland and the former Yugoslavia were very similar, but the Yugoslav strain had a slightly higher day-degree requirement. The model predicted that two or more generations would occur in southern Europe, that one generation would occur in central Europe, and that the insect would be absent from northern Europe. Most locality records for C. lunula in Europe fall within the predicted distribution. However, the insect extends further north in Scandinavia than predicted by the model, suggesting that a strain adapted to a lower summer temperature may occur there. In North America it has become established only in areas predicted by the model to be within its range.

The model predictions were compared with observed captures in pheromone traps at the experimental site of the Kagoshima Tea Experiment Research Station in Japan. The results showed that the emergence timing of the insect pest observed in the field was determined primarily by temperature. The relationship between the timing of adult emergence and the leaf damage level was also studied using a logistic regression model. The infestation level decreased as the interval between the adult peak emergence date and the date of tea plucking increased, implying that asynchrony between plant phenology and emergence of the insect pest is a critical factor reducing damage level. We examined how the damage level changes according to global warming. Increased temperature made the timing of insect appearance forward and enhance asynchrony of plant–pest phenology.

To gain a deeper understanding of how temperature influences the development and reproduction of C. vittata and to facilitate its population management, laboratory-based experiments were conducted. Individuals were subjected to a range of constant temperatures spanning from 15 °C to 36 °C. The most extended lifespans for both adult females and males were recorded at 30 °C, with respective longevities of 62.8 and 62.5 days. The highest likelihood of eggs maturing into the adult stage occurred at 25 °C, with survival rates of 39.0% for females and 37.5% for males. Preadult survival rates displayed significant variability with temperature, with the highest survivorship observed at 25 °C (76.5%). The maximum average number of offspring produced per female reached 225.1 eggs at 25 °C. Daily reproduction, maximum total fecundity, and maximum daily fecundity were also notably higher at 25 °C. The population growth parameters exhibited their most favorable values at 25 °C, with r (0.0933 d−1), and R0 (87.15 offspring per female) being highest at this temperature. The temperature thresholds for the complete pre-adult stage (1st instar larva to adult) were estimated to be 9.4 °C for females and 9.0 °C for males. The thermal constants from the 1st instar larva to the adult stage were calculated to be 526.3 and 476.2 DD, respectively.

However, maize production is severely reduced by damage caused by feeding lepidopteran pests. In East and Southern Africa, Chilo partellus is one of the most damaging cereal stem borers mainly found in the warmer lowland areas. In this study, it was hypothesized that the future distribution and abundance of C. partellus may be affected greatly by the current global warming. The temperature-dependent population growth potential of C. partellus was studied on artificial diet under laboratory conditions at six constant temperatures (15, 18, 20, 25, 28, 30, 32 and 35 °C), relative humidity of 75±5% and a photoperiod of L12:L12 h. Several non-linear models were fitted to the data to model development time, mortality and reproduction of the insect species. Cohort updating algorithm and rate summation approach were stochastically used for simulating age and stage structure populations and generate life-table parameters. For spatial analysis of the pest risk, three generic risk indices (index of establishment, generation number and activity index) were visualized in the geographical information system component of the advanced Insect Life Cycle modeling (ILCYM) software. To predict the future distribution of C. partellus we used the climate change scenario A1B obtained from WorldClim and CCAFS databases. The maps were compared with available data on the current distribution of C. partellus in Kenya. The results show that the development times of the different stages decreased with increasing temperatures ranging from 18 to 35 °C; at the extreme temperatures, 15 and 38 °C, no egg could hatch and no larvae completed development. The study concludes that C. partellus may potentially expands its range into higher altitude areas, highland tropics and moist transitional regions, with the highest maize potential where the species has not been recorded yet. This has serious implication in terms of food security since these areas produce approximately 80% of the total maize in East Africa.","Khadioli, N., Tonnang, Z. E.

Phenology models are particularly useful for cropping systems with multiple economically damaging pests throughout a season. Potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) crops of Washington State, USA, are attacked by many insect pests including the potato tuberworm ( Phthorimaea operculella Zeller), the beet leafhopper ( Circulifer tenellus Baker), and the green peach aphid ( Myzus persicae Sulzer). Each of these pests directly damages potato foliage or tubers; C. tenellus and M. persicae also transmit pathogens that can drastically reduce potato yields. We monitored the seasonal population dynamics of these pests by conducting weekly sampling on a network of commercial farms from 2007 to 2014. Using these data, we developed phenology models to characterize the seasonal population dynamics of each pest based on accumulated degree-days (DD). All three pests exhibited consistent population dynamics across seasons that were mediated by temperature. Of the three pests, C. tenellus was generally the first detected in potato crops, with 90% of adults captured by 936 DD. In contrast, populations of P. operculella and M. persicae built up more slowly over the course of the season, with 90% cumulative catch by 1,590 and 2,634 DD, respectively. Understanding these seasonal patterns could help potato producers plan their IPM strategies while allowing them to move away from calendar-based applications of insecticides. More broadly, our results show how long-term monitoring studies that explore dynamics of multiple pest species can aid in developing IPM strategies in crop systems.","D’ Auria, E. M., Wohleb, C.

IT84-124 served as the susceptible and TVNu 72 as the resistant control for both insects. Development time of C. tomentosicollis ranged from 7 days at 37 degrees C to 26 days at 19 degrees C, and decreased with increasing temperature up to an upper temperature threshold of 37 degrees C. The lower temperature threshold for development of C. tomentosicollis was estimated from regression curves to be approx. 18.5 degrees C, while the upper threshold was between 34 and 37 degrees C, the point where nymphal survivorship started to decline. Although 19 and 22 degrees C gave 90% and 80% survival, resp., the duration of development at these temperatures was almost twice that reported under field conditions. Adult weights followed an inverse relationship with temperature. Third-instar larvae of M. testulalis, obtained after rearing on artificial diet for 7 days prior to feeding on the plants, began to pupate 3 days after infestation at 28, 31 and 34 degrees C. However, adults were obtained only at 22 and 28 degrees C. Temperatures above 34 degrees C were lethal to the larvae, which dried out prior to pupating. The lower temperature threshold determined by regression for pupae was 15.6-17.8 degrees C on both IT84E-124 and MRx 10-85S. The upper temperature threshold was estimated to be between 28 and 34 degrees C, at which no adult emergence was obtained. Female pupae were larger than males and temperature did not appear to influence sex ratio. Thermal requirements, expressed in heat sums, increased with temperature for C. tomentosicollis up to 31 degrees C on all varieties.

Female scale and crawler densities on untreated trees increased each year in comparison with previous years; populations of this introduced subtropical species were recovering from a population decline possibly induced by cold temperatures in northern California during the winter of 1990-1991. In California, European fruit lecaniurn, Parthenolecanium corni (Bouche), P. pruinosum (Coquillett), and Calico scale, Eulecanium cerasorum (Cockerell), also infest Chinese hackberry. However, citricola scale was 5-25 times more abundant than the Parthenolecanium species combined, and no calico scale were found on sample branches. Citricola scale was more abundant in the east and north tree canopy in comparison with the sunnier south canopy; abiotic mortality from hot, dry conditions may help to reduce scale populations.

Non-native insects often experience novel climates, photoperiods, and host plants. How critical time periods of insect life cycles coincide with—or diverge from—phenological windows of host plant suitability could affect invasion success and the dynamics of outbreaks. Larch casebearer is an invasive defoliator that has recently undergone anomalous outbreaks on eastern larch in North America. We conducted growth chamber, greenhouse, and field studies to quantify the spring phenological window for larch casebearer on eastern larch and importance of phenological synchrony for casebearer development and survival. We constructed degree-day models of spring activity for both species and investigated responses of casebearers to early and delayed activation relative to bud break. Both species had lower developmental thresholds of  ~ 5 °C, but mean activation of casebearers occurred 245 degree-days after bud break by eastern larch. In addition to forcing temperatures, phenologies of eastern larch and casebearer larvae were significantly influenced by chilling and photoperiod, respectively. Larvae were robust to both starvation and delayed activation; days between larval activation and bud break (range: 0–58 days) had no influence on larval development and survival to adulthood. Disparate plant-insect responses to environmental cues and robustness of casebearers to changes in phenology result in a wide phenological window that likely has contributed to the insect’s broad distribution in eastern North America. Changes in phenological synchrony, however, do not appear to have facilitated recent outbreaks of larch casebearer on eastern larch.","Ward, S. F., Moon, R. D., Herms, D.

The generation time was the shortest at 29.5°C; however, only 25% of females survived to the adult stage, fecundity was low, and only 53% of the eggs hatched. The capacity for increase, rc, was low at 9.7°C, peaked at 25.7°C, and declined as temperature increased.

The flight models for these orchards were derived from the cumulative percent moth capture using two types of commercially available CM lure baited traps. Models from both types of orchards were also compared to another model known as PETE (prediction extension timing estimator) that was developed in 1970s to predict life cycle events for many fruit pests including CM across different fruit growing regions of the United States. We found that the flight phenology of CM was significantly different in commercial and abandoned orchards.

In commercial orchards, during the first and second generations, the PCM unconstrained model predicted delays in moth emergence compared to current model.

Second, the start of egg hatch was predicted from the first sustained male and female moth catches (biofix) in traps baited with pear ester (PE), PE+acetic acid (AA), PE+PH, and PH alone. Both phenological models fit data well except that the logistic provided a better fit than the PETE model of the phenology of egg hatch of the codling moth in the first generation, with a difference of 11 d between models in the prediction of 50% egg hatch. No significant difference was found between biofix dates established for males using either PH or PE+PH lures or for the biofix date based on female catches with PE+AA or PH+PE. The biofix established with the sustained female catch occurred nearly 11 d later than the male-based biofix. The use of a female biofix provided on average a 4-d improvement in the prediction of first egg hatch compared with the traditional use of a male biofix, but this difference was not significant.

The purpose of the study was to find some temperature unit so related to development that the total number of units accumulating during the period of any stage of the insect would be the same for all temperatures. The day degree (one degree acting for a period of one day) was used as the unit of temperature. In the case of the eggs, 50°F. was the lowest temperature at which development took place. The rate of development increased with the rising temperature up to 88°, after which it was retarded. The incubation periods varied from 5.52 to 14 days, with average temperatures from 61.6°F. to 84°F. The sum obtained by multiplying the day degrees above 50° by the number of days in the incubation period proved to be fairly uniform for the lower temperatures; but when the temperature was over 88° it was found necessary to subtract twice the degrees above 88° from those above 50° in order to obtain the effective day degree. On multiplying these day degrees by the number of days in the incubation period, a figure in day degrees is obtained that is uniform for all temperatures. To obtain the same results for the larval or pupal periods the principle is the same, though the figures are slightly different, the lowest temperature at which the larvae develop being about 50° and the pupae at about 52°, while the maximum development occurs at 85° and 87° respectively; thus the effective day degree for any day may be found by subtracting twice the number of degrees above the degree of maximum development from the number of degrees above the lowest degree at which development occurs, the sum of the day degrees thus obtained for the entire period being the theoretical thermal constant. This constant for the incubation period is about 163, for the larval period 673, and for the pupal period 241. For practical purposes it is necessary to use the same threshold of development (50°) for the pupa as for the egg or larva; this gives a figure of 265 for the pupa. Apart from variations caused by measurable factors, the constants still varied from 156 to 170 for the incubation period, from 527 to 873 for the larval period, and from 256 to 274 for the pupal period. Thus the effective day degrees of the three periods added together are from 939 to 1, 317, with an average of 1, 101. In taking the entire development as observed in 200 individuals, the minimum effective day degrees amounted to 950, whereas where records were kept of the first appearance of each stage the minimum appeared to be 1, 027. To the numbers 939 and 950 another 50 day degrees may be added to allow for the accumulation between the emergence of the adult and oviposition; the minimums are therefore 989, 1, 000 and 1, 027, with an average of 1, 005. The first individuals of a given brood may therefore be expected when 1, 000 effective day degrees have accumulated after the appearance of the first individuals of the previous brood. A spray programme is given based on the relation of accumulated effective day degrees and the time of the appearance of the first larvae of each generation, providing three sprays for the first, and two for each of the subsequent two broods, the first spray being applied when about two-thirds of the petals have fallen.","Glenn, P.

We used empirical data to describe the flight period of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, in its recently expanded range east of the Rocky Mountains in Canada and developed a degree-day model based on the number of trapped beetles. Data were collected over four degrees of latitude and six years. The main flight period, when the middle 70% of the total number of beetles were caught, started during the second or third week of July, lasted 26 d, and peaked within 2 wk of starting. The best model accounted for 89% of the variation in the data. Mountain pine beetle’s flight tended to start later and be more contracted at higher latitudes. The synchrony of mountain pine beetle’s flight period in the expanded range appears to be comparable to the limited reports from the historic range, although it may start earlier. This suggests that conditions in the new range are suitable for a coordinated dispersal flight, which is critical for the beetle’s strategy of overwhelming tree defenses by attacking en masse. Forest managers can use the model to support operational decisions, e.g., when to impose hauling restrictions to reduce the risk of spread through the transport of infested material, or the time frame for control programs. Understanding the flight period may also improve our ability to assess the response of mountain pine beetle to novel and changing climates in the future.","Bleiker, K. P. and Hezewijk, B.

Changes in voltinism in the pine moth Dendrolimus spectabilis (Butler), which is known to be univoltine in South Korea, were studied to elucidate the effects of climate change on their voltinism. The developmental stages of the pine moth were evaluated through field surveys, and the developmental rate was estimated at five different temperatures: 17, 20, 25, 28, and 32�C. Field surveys showed that the moths completed two generations per year, indicating that the phenology of the pine moth in this area had changed from univoltinism to bivoltinism. Laboratory experiments showed that increasing the temperature could induce a change in voltinism in the pine moth population. Generations of the bivoltine population displayed phenotypic plasticity: the fitness of the first generation was greater than that of the second generation with regard to size and fecundity. The difference in fitness between the first and second generations could be due to the influence of factors such as low food quality and heat stress on the second generation. Therefore, changes in thermal conditions due to climate change have offered this species the chance to develop a bivoltine population, but they have also exerted ecological costs, especially for the second generation of the pine moth.","Choi, W.

Thermal requirements for the development of D. speciosa were determined by the daily accumulation of thermal units (degree-day), starting from the base development temperature of the insect (11.04�?C), using maize roots cultivated in pots as larval diet. The value of the thermal constant (K) was used to predict insect occurrence, based on the mean temperatures of the soil and the air recorded during the experimental period.

Linear and nonlinear models were fitted to temperature versus developmental data and were used to predict egg hatch in the field. A four-parameter model fitted to median developmental rates (r2 = 0.99) indicated that development was linear between 16 and 28°C, optimal at 28°C, and decreased at 32°C. The lower development threshold (± SE) (10.5 ± 0.1°C) was determined by linear regression and the x-intercept method. Completion of post-diapause egg development required 258 ± 3 degree-days (± SE) above the base temperature. This compared well with the mean degree-days accumulated to 50% hatch (± SE) of 265 ± 24 which we observed in the field at several locations over 3 years using a degree-day model incorporating an 11°C developmental threshold and soil temperatures at 5- and 10-cm depths. A stochastic simulation model, incorporating a nonlinear developmental function dependant on soil temperatures taken every 2 h also predicted 50% hatch within 2 days. This model was validated in the field with 19 independent records of soil temperatures for several locations at two depths in the soil over 3 years. The simulation model accurately predicted time of 5 and 95% hatch, which indicates that this model has broad application in predicting the pattern of egg hatch for pest management.","Schaafsma, A.

Because soil conditions, topography and climate differ from those of the Midwest maize belt, questions arose as to the validity of previously published phenology models. A study was carried out to evaluate larval occurrence and adult emergence of D. v. virgifera and D. barberi in 11 fields in central New York during 1991 (2 fields), 1992 (3 fields) and 1993 (6 fields). Logistic regression models predicted cumulative occurrence/emergence from Julian date or degree-day accumulations calculated from either soil (base 11�?C) or air temperatures. Air temperature degree-days were calculated for minimum thresholds ranging from 1-16�?C. Additional accumulations were determined by varying the maximum development threshold from 1�?C above the lower threshold to 30�?C. Minimum thresholds in the latter series of calculations were set equal to 4, 6, 9 and 11�?C. Julian date was a relatively poor predictor of all immature and adult stages. However, accuracy of air temperature models was dependent on choice of thresholds. The best fitting air temperature models either used minimum development thresholds near 6�?C for immature stages and 1-2�?C for adult emergence or calculated degree-days using a minimum threshold of 11�?C and a maximum threshold of 18�?C. Both soil and air temperature models indicated regional differences in immature development and adult emergence. Although site-specific models gave the best prediction of adult emergence of D. v. virgifera, adult emergence at New York and Illinois sites could be predicted by adjusting daily air temperature degree-days by the expected accumulations from 1 January to 30 September.","Davis, P.

At 15 and 40�C, eggs did not develop and sustained 100% mortality. Similarly, larvae at 15�C and pupae at 40�C did not develop and sustained 100% mortality. For all three larval stages, the developmental time decreased with increasing temperature between 20 and 35�C and increased at 40�C. Developmental times also decreased with increasing temperature between 20 and 35�C for the pupal stage as did total developmental time from egg to adult. Both linear and nonlinear models were used to describe the relationship between developmental rates (1/d) and temperature (�C) and to determine stage-specific lower and upper developmental thresholds, respectively. The lower developmental thresholds, calculated using the linear model, ranged from 6 to 15�C for all life stages. Using the nonlinear model, the lower developmental thresholds ranged from 15 to 18�C for all life stages. Likewise, the high temperature thresholds for the first-, second-, and third-instar larvae, pupae, and total development ranged between 40 and 42�C. Results from this study were used to enhance the efficiency of mass-rearing methods for open field releases of D. elongata in California. More importantly, this study is the first step in the construction of a detailed population simulation model to predict field phenology and density of D. elongata to further optimize the use of this biological control agent in managing saltcedar in the western United States.","Herrera, A.

The Russian wheat aphid developmental data were from a laboratory experiment of 25 combinatorial treatments of five temperatures and five spring barley, Hordeum vulgare L., plant growth stages. The developmental times of 1,800 individual Russian wheat aphids at various stages were recorded in the experiment. We first compared 11 deterministic development models and discussed some problems associated with the fitting of these models. Not all nonlinear models could be fitted to every Russian wheat aphid stage. The results show that Stinner�s model overall best fit Russian wheat aphid developmental rate data, as judged by mean square error (MSE) and successful convergence. However, we observed a seemingly inescapable dilemma: when one introduces more complex nonlinear models to increase the descriptive power of models (with the hope that model parameters have some biological meanings), the more difficult it is to successfully fit the model. Even if the model is fitted successfully, the values of the model parameters may well be beyond biologically meaningful ranges. Furthermore, we believe that a potentially more serious trap associated with complex nonlinear model is the extreme low tolerance of model parameters. Our results show that the extreme low tolerance associated with the parameter estimate may occur even if the MSE of model fitting is very small. The second part of our results presented same-shape distribution models for Russian wheat aphid development. Stinner�s model performed well and successfully fitted all 22 data sets, whereas the Weibull distribution and logistic model only succeeded in 17 and six of 22 data sets, respectively.

In the Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) and its Chalcidoidea parasitoids, phenological synchrony is assumed to be weather-dependent in a new area of expansion. To evaluate the effects of environmental thermal regimes on the host, a phenology model for different cynipid stages (larvae, pupae, adults, and adult emergence) and a host–parasitoid phenological estimator are developed in three chestnut fields during two successive growth seasons and subsequently validated in areas with chestnut fields at two different altitudes. Comparisons of the timings of the juvenile and adult stages with those of the parasitoid complex demonstrate that the shortest period of occurrence for cynipids within galls has negative effects on the host–parasitoid relationships at higher temperature levels, thereby increasing phenological asynchrony for some parasitoids species. Reducing the development time of pupae and adults decreases the likelihood of success for some parasitoid species at higher temperature levels. We also record the extension of the gall wasp development time (approximately 15 days) at higher altitudes (linked to a lower mean temperature of approximately 1.5 °C). These results highlight how parasitization on the new hosts is dependent on the host phenology and, in the present study, is limited by the short duration of the presence of the host in galls, which could explain the considerable differences in cynipid gall wasp parasitization recorded at different altimeters.","Bonsignore, C.

With the potential for increased habitat suitability under predicted climate change, this pest could become even more severe in certain regions. Addressing the knowledge gap on the temperature-dependent population growth of this pest is crucial for developing a climate-resilient pest management strategy. In this study, life history data gathered at various constant temperatures (15�C to 35�C) were used to estimate developmental thresholds and thermal requirements for red cotton bug. Stochastic estimation of life table parameters and validation with real-time weather data were performed. The phenology model, integrated into a geographic information system, projected the future pest status based on SRES A1B temperature change scenarios for the year 2050. The temperatures between 8.35 � 10.83 �C as lower developmental thresholds for various immature life stages. The optimum and upper threshold temperatures estimated for different life stages ranged between 22.14 � 28.32�C and 35.80 � 39.08�C, respectively.

Simulation at fluctuating temperatures across different cotton growing locations provided reasonably similar results on potential population increase (finite rate of increase: 0.99 - 1.04 females/female/day and a generation time of 44.25 � 83.97 days). Risk mapping highlighted moderate to high suitability (ERI >0.4, GI > 6, and AI >4) of various cotton growing areas under current climate, and projected shifts in suitability under future climate change. The study has generated information valuable for implementing effective and timely pest management strategies for RCB.

At 10�?C, eggs did not hatch after 20 days and neonate larvae introduced to this temperature experienced high mortality and were unable to attain the fifth larval instar 76 days after eclosion. The developmental rate of citrus cutworm from oviposition until initiation of pupation was linearly correlated with temperature over the range of 15-25�?C and larval survival was greater than 80% for the duration of the experiment. The rate of development of citrus cutworm larvae exposed to the 30�?C treatment was similar to those exposed to 25�?C; however, larval survival at 30�?C was significantly reduced. The linear regression equation for the period of oviposition through 50% second instar larvae gave a theoretical lower developmental threshold for citrus cutworm of 7.6�?C. Based on this value, E. curialis requires approximately 258 (C) degree-days (DD) to advance from oviposition to 50% second-instar larvae in the laboratory. A dosage of 100 micrograms synthetic pheromone/lure was found to effectively monitor weekly flights of male citrus cutworm. Field studies conducted in California, USA, during 1993-99, indicate that first capture of mixed populations of first and second instar larvae begins approximately 203 DD (C) after a biofix of the second consecutive week of moth capture using a 7.6�?C lower developmental threshold. Third instar larvae began appearing an average of 315 DD (C) after the biofix. Using DD to predict first appearance of larvae and first appearance of 3rd instar larvae should improve efficacy of selective pesticides because the younger larval instars will be detected and treated.","Grafton Cardwell, E.

In growth chamber experiments, nymphs reared at photoperiods of <LD 13.5:10.5 entered reproductive diapause. Egg production and proportions of gravid females in field populations in New York State dropped sharply between 1 and 15 August in both the warm (1991) and cool (1992) growing seasons, suggesting that the onset of reproductive diapause occurs in late July-early August. Stage-specific developmental times from a 1912 study of 118 leafhopper nymphs were used to estimate degree-day requirements (base 10�?C) for eggs and the 5 nymphal stadia. These estimates were used to construct a stage-specific developmental model, which was validated with field data collected at 4 vineyards in 1991 and 1992. The model predictions agreed well with the timing of developmental events in 4 vineyards in both 1991 and 1992, years representing extremes in temperature accumulations in western and central New York. These data suggest that accumulations of >710 degree days before 1 August are required to produce a 2nd generation of E. comes under climatic conditions in New York. Variations in temperature-driven development are hypothesized to strongly influence year-to-year variability in leafhopper abundance. Degree-day accumulations by 30 June correlated well with degree-days by 1 August and may provide a useful early-warning system for predicting years in which leafhopper population densities are above average.","Martinson, T.

The insect development rate was fitted to both linear and nonlinear models to estimate thermal bioparameters, which served as the basis for constructing prediction models. Chilled apricot seeds collected in November were used for the experiments in March. Experiment 1 used intact seeds, while experiment 2 used overwintered larvae obtained by cracking the endocarp cover. Both larvae and intact seeds were subjected to seven constant temperatures (14.5, 18.8, 21.3, 24.0, 27.0, 30.2, and 34.3 �C).

We recorded the temperatures in each plot to test whether differences in temperature alone could account for the phenology of this snout beetle. To complete a full life cycle from egg to adult, the weevil required a mean of 1119.83 � 20.59 DD above a base temperature of 6.11�C.

However, the seasonal phenology of moths varies between crop cultivars and years, making it difficult to schedule the control measures. Here, we monitored male flight activity of oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta and summer fruit tortrix moth Adoxophyes orana by using sex pheromone traps in peach orchards of three different cultivars for three successive years. We developed a logistic multiple-peaks model to fit data and then calculated degree-days (DD) required for male activity and neonate emergency. Results show that G. molesta and A. orana males had 4–5 and 3 flight peaks per year, respectively. The seasonal phenology of G. molesta or A. orana was quite stable with an identical timing of each flight peak between cultivars in a year. The flight activity was usually higher in the second and third peaks for both moths, with a higher cumulative number of G. molesta males captured than that of A. orana. Compared to A. orana, G. molesta emerged early in spring and required lower degree-days to reach the subsequent flight peaks and for neonate emergency. Our results suggest that to decline the possibility of outbreaks of moths during the growing seasons, pheromone traps should be scheduled in April with a cumulative DD between 49.6 and 207.1 for G. molesta and in mid-May–early June with a cumulative DD between 450.4 and 866.7 for A. orana, aiming to trap the newly emerged male adults or disrupting female mating success of overwintered moths in orchards. Based on the thermal requirement for egg hatching (i.e., 79.4 DD for G. molesta and 90.0 DD for A. orana), insecticide treatments would be applied in late-April–early May and late May–early June to reduce the field population density of neonates of G. molesta and A. orana, respectively, to reduce fruit damage in orchards. Furthermore, pheromone traps set up in late July–early August (573.8–1025.2 DD) for G. molesta and in mid-September (1539.7–1788.9 DD) for A. orana may suppress overwintering populations and thus decrease pest infestation in next year.","Ma, A., Zhang, H., Ran, H., et al.",2023,Prediction of seasonal population dynamics of Grapholita molesta (Busck) and Adoxophyes orana (Fischer von Röslerstamm) in peach orchards using sex pheromone trap and degree-days and its implications in pest management,Frontiers in Agronomy,5,1269977,Lepidoptera,Tortricidae,Grapholita,molesta,13,Wingspan,Averaged:10-16,https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.1079/cabicompendium.29904,18,wood,N,Y, https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.1079/cabicompendium.29904,1,Included

Timely management of the egg and early larval stages from the spring emergence is critical to reduce the G. molesta population during the pear growing season. A model was developed to precisely predict the spring occurrence of G. molesta adults as a function of accumulated degree-days. The model was validated with male moth caught in sex pheromone-baited traps placed in pear orchards at two major pear production regions (Icheon and Naju) of Korea in 2010. We applied nine distribution models to describe the cumulative proportions of G. molesta males caught relative to accumulated degree-days. The observed phenology of the G. molesta spring population was well described by the nine models. The predicted dates for the cumulative 50% male moth catches were within a 5 day period. Based on statistical information criteria (Akaike's and Bayes–Schwartz information criteria), we recommend the sigmoid function referred by Brown and Mayer, because of its ease of use and meaningfulness; the parameter “b” denotes the degree-day accumulation at 50% moth emergence. The G. molesta spring emergence model could be applied to determine optimal chemical treatment timing for controlling G. molesta in fruit tree orchards and further help to develop a full-cycle phenology model of G. molesta.","Ahn, J.

Infested young leaves were higher in soluble protein and total nitrogen but lower in latex content than infested mature leaves, which is taken to indicate that young foliage is more suitable for thrips than mature foliage. In addition, the mature leaf galls were colonized by the predators Chrysoperla carnea and Macrotracheliella nigra. Both predatory species consumed more adult thrips than immatures in preference tests; the number of individuals consumed within a 24-h feeding trial suggested that the predators may cause significant mortality within the mature galls.

DD based on the common LT of 10.7 �C were 43, 287, and 191 DD for eggs, larvae, and pupae, respectively. DD model (253.6 DD with LT 10.3 �C for larvae and 181.5 DD with 11.6 �C for pupae) showed good performance in predicting the 50% occurrences of pupae and adults. In nonlinear models, stage transition (ST) models were constructed using the development rate and distribution models to simulate the proportion of individuals shifted from one stage to the next stage. The ST model showed good performance, indicating an average discrepancy of 1.74 days at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% adult emergence. Our models developed here will be useful to predict the phenology of H. armigera in the field and to construct a deterministic population model in the future.","Jung, J. K., Kim, S. B., Seo, B.

For secondary forest pests, such as the pine bark beetle Ips sexdentatus, the resulting increase in population level could trigger more frequent outbreaks. However, this positive effect could be outweighed by a temperature-dependent decrease in offspring quality. To test these hypotheses, we carried out a laboratory rearing experiment with maritime pine logs at six temperature regimes reproducing hourly fluctuations and averaging 12–25.5 °C. We estimated the thermal requirements for a complete development of the beetle and the number of offspring per female. The offspring quality was estimated using three traits: dry body weight, elytra length and lipid content. The minimum and maximum developmental threshold were estimated at 10.9 and 36 °C, respectively, and the thermal requirements for complete development were estimated at 517 degree-days. We predicted a mean of two generations per year in southwestern France, although an additional generation could occur during warmer years. The number of offspring increased exponentially with temperature, although we observed a curvilinear response of offspring traits to temperature, with optima at 15–18 °C. This suggests that there are trade-offs between productivity and quality of offspring. Global warming is therefore likely to result in higher number of generations of I. sexdentatus per year, with larger broods but of reduced fitness at high temperatures.","Pineau, X., David, G., Peter, Z., et al.",2017,"Effect of temperature on the reproductive success, development rate and brood characteristics of Ips sexdentatus (Boern.)",Agricultural and Forest Entomology,19.1,23-33,Coleoptera,Curculionidae,Ips,sexdentatus,6.85,Body,Averaged: 5.5-8.2,https://download.ceris.purdue.edu/file/3086,18,wood,N,Y,https://plantwiseplusknowledgebank.org/doi/10.1079/pwkb.species.28839#sec-4,1,Included

This grass is a problematic weed in Florida and Australia, but it is a highly valued forage in Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela. We studied the influence of nine constant temperatures (8–38°C) on the developmental time and survival of I. variegatus. Complete egg and nymphal mortality occurred at temperatures ≤20.5°C and at 38°C. Developmental time decreased linearly with temperature until 28–30°C and then increased at 33°C. Mortality of first, second, and third instars was high across all temperatures. Developmental time across all temperatures was greatest for eggs, first and fifth instars compared with other stages. Linear and Brière-1 nonlinear models were used to determine the lower temperature threshold at which the developmental rate (1/D) approached zero. The lower thresholds to complete development (egg to adult) estimated with the linear and nonlinear model were 14.6 and 17.4°C, respectively. The total degree-days required to complete development estimated by the linear model was 588. Using temperature data from Florida, a map was generated to project a prediction grid of I. variegatus generations per yr. Based on these predictions, the insect can complete three to five generations per year in areas currently invaded in Florida. Results of this study will be used to understand the potential distribution and population growth of I. variegatus in H. amplexicaulis infested regions.","Diaz, R., Overholt, W. A., Cuda, J.

The day-degree model, the logistic equation, and the Wang model were used to describe the relationships between temperature and development rate at constant and alternating temperatures. The three models were then used with a Weibull function describing the distribution of development times, to simulate the development of individuals of cohorts at natural temperature regimes. Comparison of the observed with simulated distributions of adult emergence indicated that all three models can simulate the development of L. erysimi equally well when temperature does not go below 6�?C (the notional low temperature threshold of the day-degree model) or above 30�?C. When accumulation of temperatures below 6�?C becomes substantial, only the logistic curve offers accurate simulations; the other two models give falsely longer durations of development. When accumulation of temperatures above 30�?C becomes substantial, the logistic curve and the Wang model offer more accurate simulations than the day-degree model, which tends to produce shorter durations of development. Further analysis of the data reveals that development rate of this aphid at a given unfavourable high temperature may vary with time.

Overwintering is a key element of survival for L. delicatula. Ability for cold tolerance showed the temporal changes during the overwintering season of L. delicatula, in Korea. In the field, hatching rate (%) of egg masses showed 72.1, 33.1, 84.3 and 52.3 % in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. January was well explained time by following population size of 1st nymph in Korea. Therefore, I suggested the relationship between hatchability and temperature in January. The hatching rate of 1st nymph L. delicatula in field was well predicted in these models. Diapause development was applied for the hatching model of overwintering L. delicatula eggs. The relationship between egg developmental rate and temperature was described in a linear model and a non-linear model. The lower developmental threshold temperature was 11.13 C, and the thermal constant was at 293.26 degree days. Hatching model was well validated in 1st nymph of L. delicatula collected in field. Seasonal occurrence of L. delicatula was investigated among three host plants (Vitis vinifera, Ailanthus altissima and Morus alba). Female ratio of L. delicatula sampled from A. altissima was ranged from 35 to 45 %. The occurrence data were fitted to the logistic model based on the degree days (base 11.13 C). Therefore, accumulated degree days were calculated as 271, 492, 620 and 908 DD, at 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th instar nymph in the peak time of A. altissima, respectively. This model was not incorporated into adult stage of L. delicatula, because of its dispersal behavior on A. altissima. We isolated and characterized eight microsatellite loci for L. delicatula by using a hybridization-biotin enrichment method. Population genetic structure was conducted among nine locations in Korea. Isolation by distance (IBD) suggested that populations in South Korea have not yet reached genetic equilibrium, also genetic differentiation (global FST=0.0474) indicated in range expansion recently. Bayesian-based clustering analysis indicated the presence of at least three genetically unique populations in Korea, which showed a distinct genetic background in Cheonan and Samcheok. The assignment test suggested that long-distance dispersal of L. delicatula may have occurred over large areas of South Korea. More complex dispersal patterns may have occurred during L. delicatula invasion of heterogeneous landscapes in South Korea. Also, we evaluated the sink-source metapopulations at four locations (Cheonan, Daegu, Suwon and Gwangju) in Korea. Cheonan showed relatively larger effective population size (Ne) and lower immigration rate (m) than other regions. A comparison among life stages, AMOVA showed different genetic variation between nymph and post-oviposition populations. Also, subgraph was constructed by post-oviposition in full graph with 29 edges. Therefore, genetic parameters were partially implied by the oviposition and were triggered for active dispersal of L. delicatula. Integrated genetics and population ecology may provide the improved management plans and insight for hidden invasion phenomena of L. delicatula in Korea.","Park, M.",2015,Overwintering ecology and population genetics of Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae) in Korea,"Doctoral diss., Seoul National University",-,-,Hemiptera,Fulgoridae,Lycorma,delicatula,25,Body,,https://inspection.canada.ca/en/plant-health/invasive-species/insects/spotted-lanternfly/spotted-lanternfly,70,wood,N,Y,https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/ORN/TREES/spotted_lanternfly.html,0,Included

Data were collected from 16 plots located in the leading edge area of the L. dispar infestation in Virginia. A stochastic phenology model was used to describe larval phenology; regression lines were constructed to describe cumulative pupal occurrence and cumulative capture of male moths over time (day-degrees). Comparison among plots of the stochastic-model parameter sets and day-degree accumulation that describe larval phenology in physiological time indicated that high levels of defoliation did not influence larval development (defoliation of more than _70% is considered high). In calendar days, the period required for larval development was reduced in plots with high levels of defoliation. Comparison of the slopes and intercepts of regression lines among plots for cumulative pupal occurrence indicated that pupal phenology was altered significantly in plots with high levels of defoliation; the sex ratio of pupae was male-skewed in these plots. Comparison of the slopes and intercepts of regression lines among plots for cumulative moth captures indicated that capture was not related to defoliation level. Defoliation apparently can have a significant effect on larval phenology (measured in calendar days), pupal phenology and the sex ratio of pupae, but the effect on these life stages is not reflected in the capture of males.

As a result of adjusting the hyperbolic constants to compensate for the departure from true linearity encountered with the curvilinear method, these constants were estimated to be 230 and 475 day-degrees F for mean egg and nymphal development, respectively (at a base temperature of 51 deg F). In the field, adoption of a base temperature of 50 deg F and hyperbolic constants of 242 and 500 for egg hatch and nymphal development permits the utilisation of the growing day-degree system.

Cumulative weekly increases in thermal units decreased the time of H0 of field-collected eggs incubated at controlled temperatures but had no effect on the lower larval development threshold (Tb). The number of larvae emerging daily from egg masses held at controlled temperatures was temperature-dependent, asynchronous, and indicated that diapause of the pharate larva was terminated before 31 January. For 3 consecutive years, the H0 among annually deposited egg masses on the same tree was asynchronous, several days lapsing between the 1st and last H0. The daily rate of emergence among individual egg masses on the same tree was also asynchronous. The number of days to estimated median larval emergence (E50) was variable, and the duration of larval emergence averaged 12 +or- 1.2 days. Daily emergence appears to be relatively independent of temperature. Thus, reducing the risk of mortality of early instars from late winter storms by asynchronous emergence in early spring is a behaviour that is apparently random and appears to be under genetic control.","Neal, J.

A linear phenological model using the parameters derived from the biophysical model accurately predicted the developmental time of the early generation of M. matrida in groundnut fields in Israel, but failed to predict developmental time of later generations. Predictive extension timing estimation, a time varying distribution delay model, accurately predicted the occurrence of both early and late generations.","Harari, A. R., D.

Phenology models are particularly useful for cropping systems with multiple economically damaging pests throughout a season. Potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) crops of Washington State, USA, are attacked by many insect pests including the potato tuberworm ( Phthorimaea operculella Zeller), the beet leafhopper ( Circulifer tenellus Baker), and the green peach aphid ( Myzus persicae Sulzer). Each of these pests directly damages potato foliage or tubers; C. tenellus and M. persicae also transmit pathogens that can drastically reduce potato yields. We monitored the seasonal population dynamics of these pests by conducting weekly sampling on a network of commercial farms from 2007 to 2014. Using these data, we developed phenology models to characterize the seasonal population dynamics of each pest based on accumulated degree-days (DD). All three pests exhibited consistent population dynamics across seasons that were mediated by temperature. Of the three pests, C. tenellus was generally the first detected in potato crops, with 90% of adults captured by 936 DD. In contrast, populations of P. operculella and M. persicae built up more slowly over the course of the season, with 90% cumulative catch by 1,590 and 2,634 DD, respectively. Understanding these seasonal patterns could help potato producers plan their IPM strategies while allowing them to move away from calendar-based applications of insecticides. More broadly, our results show how long-term monitoring studies that explore dynamics of multiple pest species can aid in developing IPM strategies in crop systems.","D’ Auria, E. M., Wohleb, C.

Because of its frequent presence in export fruit packages, it is also considered an important quarantine pest to countries that trade with New Zealand. To provide critical information for the pest risk analysis, forecast and management of N. huttoni, we investigated the effect of five consistent temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 deg C) on its development, survival and reproduction. At 10 deg C both eggs and nymphs did not develop but the latter grew. Nymphs could survive 10 deg C for >1.5 months, with the fifth instar nymphs surviving for up to 145 days. Adults could live for at least 100 days at this temperature. This species could not complete its life cycle at or below 15 deg C. Between 15 and 30 deg C, fifth instar stage was significantly longer than other nymphal stages. Egg hatch rate and total survival rate for all stages were significantly higher at 20 deg C than at other test t emperatures. The developmental rate of different life stages increased linearly with the increase of temperatures from 15 to 30 deg C. The estimated low temperature threshold for the completion of life cycle was 11.9 deg C, and that for mating and oviposition was 12.3 and 16.8 deg C, respectively. The thermal requirement for completing a life cycle of N. huttoni was 625 degree-days. The time needed for completing a life cycle was similar for both sexes. Temperature had little effect on adult body weight and sex ratio. Implications of the above findings are discussed.","He, X., Q. Wang, et al.

The results indicate that the species differ in the developmental rates, survival curves and cumulative hatching probabilities. The eggs of O. haemorrhoidalis had the fastest developmental rate with a low developmental threshold temperature of 9.9 degrees C and the sum of effective temperature (SET) 211.2 degree-days (DD).

Its broad host range of at least 20 eucalypt species and wide geographical distribution provides it the potential to become a serious forestry pest both within Australia and, if accidentally introduced, overseas. Although populations of P. atomaria are genetically similar throughout its range, population dynamics differ between regions. Here, we determine temperature-dependent developmental requirements using beetles sourced from temperate and subtropical zones by calculating lower temperature thresholds, temperature-induced mortality, and day-degree requirements. We combine these data with field mortality estimates of immature life stages to produce a cohort-based model, ParopSys, using DYMEX� that accurately predicts the timing, duration, and relative abundance of life stages in the field and number of generations in a spring�autumn (September�May) field season. Voltinism was identified as a seasonally plastic trait dependent upon environmental conditions, with two generations observed and predicted in the Australian Capital Territory, and up to four in Queensland. Lower temperature thresholds for development ranged between 4 and 9 �C, and overall development rates did not differ according to beetle origin. Total immature development time (egg�adult) was approximately 769.2 � S.E. 127.8 DD above a lower temperature threshold of 6.4 � S.E. 2.6 �C. ParopSys provides a basic tool enabling forest managers to use the number of generations and seasonal fluctuations in abundance of damaging life stages to estimate the pest risk of P. atomaria prior to plantation establishment, and predict the occurrence and duration of damaging life stages in the field. Additionally, by using local climatic data the pest potential of P. atomaria can be estimated to predict the risk of it establishing if accidentally introduced overseas.

The whole day, sine wave method with a horizontal upper cutoff was found to be the best of several methods for calculating daily heat sums. Dates of beginning and peak spring emergence from overwintering diapaused larvae were determined from plots of adult male captures in 48 pheromone-baited survey traps situated along roadsides throughout the cotton producing area. Using the same method, heat sums from 1 February (determined to be the best starting date for heat accumulation) to the peak of spring moth emergence were calculated to be 510 DD (centigrade). Two weeks before peak infested cotton flowers was used as the date for initial in-field infestation. Numbers of males of P. gossypiella captured in field-situated pheromone traps were used to establish subsequent peak activity points for the 1st and 2nd generations. Using 12 of these generation events and the 13.9/32.8�?C thresholds, horizontal cutoff, and whole day sine wave method, the heat sum for 1 generation, adult to adult, was determined to be 492 DD.

The model, phenModel, was developed based on development times of different life cycle stages (eggs, larvae, pupae, pre-oviposition, oviposition, sexual maturation) obtained from constant temperature laboratory experiments. As part of this study, a number of linear and non-linear models which describe the temperature-dependent development rate (inverse of development time) for each of the different life cycle stages were fitted. Based on the criteria of model parsimony and model fit, the non-linear Lactin-2 model was chosen as the optimum model to describe temperature-driven development in P. vulgatissima. To account for the variation in development times between individuals, an important but often ignored aspect in phenology models, a number of stochastic models (2- and 3- parameter Weibull and logistic models) were evaluated, based on the assumption that normalised development times conform to a similar shaped ('same shape') distribution. Novel aspects of the phenology model include the incorporation of a biologically relevant biofix, based on a budburst model for Salix viminalis, and a photoperiod threshold to induce facultative diapause. The model, which is written in R for accessibility, requires inputs of daily minimum and maximum temperature and site latitude and produces outputs describing the timing of completion of developmental stages for specified proportions of the population. It was evaluated against available field data and found to largely reproduce the observations providing a measure of its potential utility. A key component of the model allows for a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters. The model is structured so that it can easily be adapted for other leaf-feeding beetles which display a facultative reproductive diapause cued by photoperiod, and where the onset of oviposition is dependent on budburst, assuming relevant life cycle stage parameters are available.","Pollard, C.

In simulated summer, spring (or autumn), and winter conditions of temperature and photoperiod in the laboratory, the duration of the egg, larval, prepupal and pupal stages and adult pre-oviposition period were 5-25, 18-60, 2.5-18, 8-23 and 2-23 days, respectively. A mean of 8471 hour-degrees above 10 deg C was required for a complete generation. A 50% increase in the hour-degree requirement of the prepupa in the winter regimen indicated a lowering of the intrinsic metabolic rate and provided evidence for the prepupa being the main overwintering stage. The winter regimen bordered on the lower temperature threshold for adult function. The adult sex ratio of about 0.5 was not affected by temperature. Life-tables for the 3 regimens showed Type-II to Type-III mortality curves. Potential multiplication rates were estimated to be 20.4, 39.6 and 0.98 for the 3 regimens, respectively. First-instar larvae were prevented from reaching tubers in the laboratory by as little as 0.5 cm of soil, and increased soil moisture enhanced this inhibition. Accessibility of developing tubers to ovipositing adults was important in the field. Under normal cultivation methods, 45% of the plant rhizosphere was at high risk of infestation; this could be reduced to 25-39% by greater soil coverage and to 7% by increasing soil moisture. Leaf mining regularly occurred between mid-January and mid-May, densities reaching a peak of 50-150 larvae/plant in February. Mining continued throughout the year at low levels. Seasonal variation in population density at Pukekohe was regulated largely by temperature, and adult population peaks closely coincided with peaks of larval foliage mining. Flight activity increased with increase in temperature, and was inhibited by wind speeds greater than 3 m/s. Adult sex ratio was positively correlated with population density of the preceding generation. Apanteles subandinus Blanch., which was introduced into New Zealand in the late 1960s, was present at Pukekohe when observations began in 1972, and although parasitism of larvae rose to 45% in the overwintering population in 1973, this was insufficient to prevent the occurrence of a large and damaging population of P. operculella the following summer.","Foot, M.

Knowledge of the temperature-dependent population growth potential is crucial for understanding population dynamics and implementing pest control strategies in different agro-ecological zones. The development, mortality of immature life stages, and reproduction of P. operculella were studied at constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 32°C. The theoretical developmental thresholds were 11, 13.5, and 11.8°C, and required incubation times were 65.3, 165.1, and 107.6 degree-days (DD) for the egg, larval, and pupal stages, respectively. The nonlinear shape of the temperature–development curve at low temperatures was well described by the modified four-parameter Sharpe & DeMichele model. The log-normal function was fitted to the normalized cumulative frequency distributions of developmental times for each life stage. Temperature effects on immature mortality were described by polynomial regressions. The optimal temperature for survival was within the range of 20–30°C. Temperature effects on adult senescence were described by the modified Sharpe & DeMichele model. A polynomial function was fitted to total fecundity and temperature. Fecundity was highest around 21°C. Age-related cumulative proportions of fecundity were well described by a Gamma function. Most eggs were laid within the first quarter of the female life span. The established functions were used to build a P. operculella population model, and life table parameters were simulated over a range of temperatures.

The modeling of temperature-dependent development can be useful in forecasting occurrence and population dynamics of the pests. Published developmental parameters for this pest vary greatly for many reasons. We determined temperature-dependent development of P. operculella at seven constant temperatures (16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 34 and 36 °C). Developmental period of whole immature stage (egg to the end of the pupal stage) varied from 75.5  days at 16 °C to 17 days at 32 °C. The population failed to survive at 36 °C. The observed data was modeled to determine mathematical functions for simulating P. operculella development in each stage of development and overall. Two linear models, ordinary linear regression and the Ikemoto linear model were used to describe the relationship between temperature and development rate of the different stages of P. operculella and estimating the thermal constant and lower temperature threshold. The lower temperature threshold (t) and thermal constant (k) of whole immature stage were estimated to be 11.6 °C and 338.5 DD by Ikemoto linear model, and the estimated parameters were not substantially different with those estimated by ordinary linear models. Different models provided a better fit to the various developmental stages. Of the eleven nonlinear models fitted, the Beriere-1, Logan-6 and Lactin-1 model was found to be the best for modeling development rate of egg, larva and pupa of P. operculella, respectively. Phenological models based on these findings can be part of a decision-support tool to improve the efficiency of pest management programs.","Golizadeh, A., and Zalucki, M.

Phenology models are particularly useful for cropping systems with multiple economically damaging pests throughout a season. Potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) crops of Washington State, USA, are attacked by many insect pests including the potato tuberworm ( Phthorimaea operculella Zeller), the beet leafhopper ( Circulifer tenellus Baker), and the green peach aphid ( Myzus persicae Sulzer). Each of these pests directly damages potato foliage or tubers; C. tenellus and M. persicae also transmit pathogens that can drastically reduce potato yields. We monitored the seasonal population dynamics of these pests by conducting weekly sampling on a network of commercial farms from 2007 to 2014. Using these data, we developed phenology models to characterize the seasonal population dynamics of each pest based on accumulated degree-days (DD). All three pests exhibited consistent population dynamics across seasons that were mediated by temperature. Of the three pests, C. tenellus was generally the first detected in potato crops, with 90% of adults captured by 936 DD. In contrast, populations of P. operculella and M. persicae built up more slowly over the course of the season, with 90% cumulative catch by 1,590 and 2,634 DD, respectively. Understanding these seasonal patterns could help potato producers plan their IPM strategies while allowing them to move away from calendar-based applications of insecticides. More broadly, our results show how long-term monitoring studies that explore dynamics of multiple pest species can aid in developing IPM strategies in crop systems.","D’ Auria, E. M., Wohleb, C.

We studied the population growth of the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.) under six constant temperatures, to understand and predict population changes along altitudinal gradients and under climate change scenarios. Non-linear functions were fitted to continuously model DBM development, mortality, longevity and oviposition. We compiled the best-fitted functions for each life stage to yield a phenology model, which we stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters. Three temperature-dependent indices (establishment, generation and activity) were derived from a logistic population growth model and then coupled to collected current (2013) and downscaled temperature data from AFRICLIM (2055) for geospatial mapping. To measure and predict the impacts of temperature change on the pest�s biology, we mapped the indices along the altitudinal gradients of Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) and Taita Hills (Kenya) and assessed the differences between 2013 and 2055 climate scenarios. The optimal temperatures for development of DBM were 32.5, 33.5 and 33�C for eggs, larvae and pupae, respectively. Mortality rates increased due to extreme temperatures to 53.3, 70.0 and 52.4% for egg, larvae and pupae, respectively. The net reproduction rate reached a peak of 87.4 female offspring/female/generation at 20�C. Spatial simulations indicated that survival and establishment of DBM increased with a decrease in temperature, from low to high altitude. However, we observed a higher number of DBM generations at low altitude. The model predicted DBM population growth reduction in the low and medium altitudes by 2055. At higher altitude, it predicted an increase in the level of suitability for establishment with a decrease in the number of generations per year. If climate change occurs as per the selected scenario, DBM infestation may reduce in the selected region. The study highlights the need to validate these predictions with other interacting factors such as cropping practices, host plants and natural enemies.","Ngowi, B. V., Tonnang, H. E., Mwangi, E.

Since temperature is the major abiotic factor influencing insect development and thermal requirements may vary among insect populations, it is important to know the effect of temperature on development and survival of a subtropical strain of P. xylostella. Development and survival of the diamondback moth was evaluated under seven constant temperatures ranging from 10°C to 35°C. Development was completed between 10°C and 32.5°C, but at 35°C all individuals died in the larval stage. Data were fitted to one linear and five nonlinear models. Considering as criteria the goodness of fit and the ability to estimate parameters of biological significance, the models Briere-1 and Briere-2 were the most adequate to describe the relationship between temperature and development of P. xylostella. The linear model demonstrated that P. xylostella required 312.5 degree-days above a lower threshold of 6.3°C to complete development. The degree-day model showed that the number of diamondback moth generations in the tropical region of Brazil is nearly twice the number in the subtropical region of the country. This result explains, at least in part, the higher population levels of this species in the tropical region of Brazil, and also demonstrates that P. xylostella is tolerant to a wide range of temperatures (6.1-32.5°C). Therefore, temperature cannot be considered a limiting factor for the occurrence of diamondback moth throughout the year in most regions of Brazil.  ","Marchioro, C. A., and Foerster, L.

Degree-day requirements were found broadly to explain the relative distributions and differences in voltinism of A. urticae, P. c-album and I. io. The migrant V. atalanta did not fit into the predicted pattern, and this species may be more limited by its ability to overwinter. Although the most northerly distributed species, A. urticae, had the lowest degree-day requirement, it had the highest developmental threshold and performed best (for mortality, pupal weight and relative growth rate) at high experimental temperatures. It is suggested that this may be due to the gregarious nature of its larvae and their possible ability to thermoregulate. At southern margins, different distributional limits may be explained partly by larval gregariousness (a more northern trait) and maximum temperatures at which development is possible. Limits to the distributions of these mobile species are at least partially explicable by the interaction of climatic patterns and thermal biology.

Development of eggs and pupae was similar at 40, 70, 80 and 90% RH. Significant differences were detected between studies in the egg hatch to adult development and larval development, attributable, in part, to differences in the degree of compaction of ground maize used for rearing insects.

Data from California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) weather stations were used to match orchard-year datasets with historical climatic data on degree-day (DD) accumulation, winter chill, and winter rainfall. A cumulative Weibull distribution was used to model the relationship between cumulative trap catch and DD accumulation for R. completa in California.

The prediction for 50% cumulative trap catch of R. completa in California was much higher than the thermal requirement estimated in Oregon previously (1,751 DDs). Linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate other environmental and orchard-specific factors which could explain the large variation between predicted and observed thermal requirements for both the start and mid-point of the flight period. Latitude, walnut cultivar leaf-out time, orchard age and year, as a continuous variable, all contributed significantly to explain deviations from the predictions of the DD model for individual orchard years.

This temperature range may be an adaptation of R. conicus for synchronization with musk thistle. The highest mortalities of the larvae of R. conicus occurred in the 1st and 4th instars.","Smith, L.

Model development of S. incertulas adult flight phenology used climatic data and historical field observations of S. incertulas from 1962 through 1988. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate 5,203 prospective models with starting dates ranging from 1 January (day 1) to 30 April (day 121) and base temperatures ranging from −3 through 18.5°C. From six candidate models, which shared the lowest standard deviation of prediction error, a model with a base temperature of 10°C starting on 19 January was selected for validation. Validation with linear regression evaluated the differences between predicted and observed events and showed the model consistently predicted phenological events of 10 to 90% cumulative flight activity within a 3.5-d prediction interval regarded as acceptable for pest management decision making. The degree-day phenology model developed here is expected to find field application in Guandong Province. Expansion to other areas of rice production will require field validation. We expect the degree-day characterization of the activity period will remain essentially intact, but the start day may vary based on climate and geographic location. The development and validation of the phenology model of the S. incertulas by using procedures originally developed for pecan nut casebearer, Acrobasis nuxvorella Neunzig, shows the fungibility of this approach to developing prediction models for other insects.","Stevenson, D.

The temperature thresholds for the embryonic, larval, pre-pupal, pupal periods and total cycle were 9.34�?C, 11.65�?C, 9.65�?C, 11.08�?C and 11.23�?C, with thermal constants of 62,73 degree-days (DD), 254.61DD, 33.42DD, 177.55DD and 525.11DD, respectively. Evaluating the pupal phase alone, the threshold temperatures were 11.25�?C for males and 10.81�?C for females, with thermal constants of 188.26DD for males and 165.47DD for females. For total cycle, the threshold temperature and the thermal constant for males were 11.28�?C and 535.85DD, whereas for females the same variables had values of 11.15�?C and 513.17DD. So, the most adequate temperature for the development of S. cosmioides is within the range of 25�?C and 28�?C, where 9.6 to 11.7 generations of the insect can be annually obtained, in laboratory conditions.","Bavaresco, A., M.

Larvae of the noctuid were fed leaves of Mimosa scabrella. The life cycle, pupal weight and percentage of survival were inversely proportional to the temperature. At 17 deg C, the time from oviposition to adult emergence lasted 115.5 days, while at 30 deg C it lasted 33.0 days. The pupal weight ranged from 190.2 mg to 282.7 mg at 30 and 17 deg C, resp. The survival rate was higher at 17 deg C (86.7%) than at 30 deg C (66.7%). The optimum temperature for the pest to develop on M. scabrella was between 20 and 25 deg C, since temperatures above 25 deg C increased the mortality rate and those below 20 deg C increased the life cycle excessively. The lower thermal thresholds were 10.97 deg C for the egg stage, 9.87 deg C for the larval stage, 12.37 deg C for the pupal stage and 10.75 deg C for the whole life cycle. The thermal constants required for the noctuid to complete each stage were 56.9 day-degrees C for the egg, 444.3 day-degrees C for the larva, 139.3 day-degrees C for the pupa and 639.9 day-degrees C for the whole life cycle. In the absence of preferred hosts, the noctuid can cause severe defoliation of M. scabrella during the hotter months of the year in areas where the plant is used for reforestation in the southern region of Brazil.","Foerster, L.

E. Smith) is a polyphagous and highly destructive invasive insect pest of many crops. It was recently introduced into India and widely reported in almost all parts of India. Development of a temperature-based phenology model for predicting its rate of development and distribution will help in understanding the establishment and further spread of introduced invasive insect pests. Development, survival and reproduction parameters of S. frugiperda at six constant temperature conditions (15, 20, 25, 27, 30 and 35�C) were investigated and further validated with data generated under fluctuating temperature conditions. The estimated lower developmental threshold temperatures were 12.1�C for eggs, 11�C for larvae, 12.2�C for pupae, 15.13�C for males and 12.66�C for females. Degree-day (DD) requirements for the development of the different stages of S. frugiperda were 50, 250 and 200 DD for egg, larva and pupa, respectively. The best-fitted functions were compiled for each life stage to yield a phenology model, which was stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters. The developed phenology model predicted temperature ranges between 27 and 30�C as favourable for S. frugiperda development, survival and reproduction. The results revealed that maximum net reproductive rate (215.66 females/female/generation) and total fecundity (981.08 individuals/female/generation) were attained at 30�C constant temperature. The mean length of generations decreased from 74.29 days at 15�C to 38.74 days at 30�C. The maximum intrinsic rate of increase (0.138 females/female/day) and shortest doubling time (4.9 days) were also observed at 30�C. Results of simulated life table parameters showed high temperature-dependent development of S. frugiperda and complete development within all the tested constant temperature ranges (15�35�C). Simulated life table parameters for predicting risk indices of S. frugiperda in India indicated a significant increase in activity indices and establishment risk indices with a higher number of generations during future (2050 and 2070) climatic change scenarios compared to present conditions. Our results indicate that India will be highly suitable for the establishment and survival of S. frugiperda in future time periods.","Prasad, T. V., Rao, M. S., Rao, K.

With a changing climate, there is the potential for this insect to become an increasingly severe pest in certain regions due to increased habitat suitability. To examine this possibility, we developed temperature-based phenology model for S. litura, by constructing thermal reaction norms for cohorts of single life stages, at both constant and fluctuating temperatures within the ecologically relevant range (15�38�C) for its development. Life table parameters were estimated stochastically using cohort updating and rate summation approach. The model was implemented in the geographic information system to examine the potential future pest status of S. litura using temperature change projections from SRES A1B climate change scenario for the year 2050. The changes were visualized by means of three spatial indices demonstrating the risks for establishment, number of generations per year and pest abundance according to the temperature conditions. The results revealed that the development rate as a function of temperature increased linearly for all the immature stages of S. litura until approximately 34�36�C, after which it became non-linear. The extreme temperature of 38�C was found lethal to larval and pupal stages of S. litura wherein no development to the next stage occurred. Females could lay no eggs at the extreme low (15�C) and high (> 35�C) test temperatures, demonstrating the importance of optimum temperature in determining the suitability of climate for the mating and reproduction in S. litura. The risk mapping predicts that due to temperature increase under future climate change, much of the soybean areas in Indian states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, will become suitable for S. litura establishment and increased pest activity, indicating the expansion of the suitable and favourable areas over time. This has serious implication in terms of soybean production since these areas produce approximately 95% of the total soybeans in India. As the present model results are based on temperature only, and the effects of other abiotic and biotic factors determining the pest population dynamics were excluded, it presents only the potential population growth parameters for S. litura. However, if combined with the field observations, the model results could certainly contribute to gaining insight into the field dynamics of S. litura","Fand, B. B., Sul, N. T., Bal, S.

However, because the moth’s observed range has expanded into the northern and eastern United States, there is concern that suitable temperatures before May could allow for significant S. albicosta development. Daily blacklight moth catch and temperature data from four Nebraska locations were used to construct degree-day models using simple or sine-wave methods, starting dates between 1 January and 1 May, and lower (−5 to 15°C) and upper (20 to 43.3°C) developmental thresholds.

(Lep., Notodontidae), in Central Europe has increased since the 1990s. Given potential climatic and land-use changes, increased abundance and range expansion of OPM may occur in the future. These changes could lead to more severe defoliation of oaks and higher threats to humans and animals, caused by the urticating hairs (setae) released by OPM larvae. These negative impacts on oak trees, people and animals urgently require effective hazard mitigation strategies.  For OPM hazard assessment and decision support on OPM monitoring and control, the online early warning system �PHENTHAUproc � phenology modelling of Thaumetopoea processionea� was created and validated. PHENTHAUproc implements daily updated temperature-based procedures to calculate the phenological development of OPM and to model the host trees� phenology, i.e. bud swelling and leaf unfolding of Quercus robur L.  The hatching date of the first instar larvae (L1) is calculated using three different already existing models. To determine the onset of L1 feeding, a bud swelling model for Q. robur was generated for the first time. The phenological development of OPM larvae and pupae is predicted by a model which was first created based on laboratory rearing data for the distinct development stages.  Moreover, an existing leaf unfolding model for Q. robur was included into PHENTHAUproc. The predicted date of leaf unfolding can be complemented by in situ observations of leaf unfolding by the German Meteorological Service (DWD). The predicted dates of leaf unfolding and OPM forth instar development are used to define the optimal timespan for control measures such as the prophylactic spraying of biological insecticides. In addition, modelling of larval and pupal development can be used to estimate the seasonally increasing hazard resulting from setae dissemination, as well as to calculate the onset of monitoring of flying moths with pheromone traps.  PHENTHAUproc provides phenological forecasts on a local and regional level, i.e. for weather station locations and raster maps countrywide. The models can be used anywhere in Europe as soon as air temperature data and information on potential adaptations of OPM to local climate and host tree phenology are available. This enables phenological forecasts for timely and effective protection of oak tree vitality as well as human and animal health against OPM-related hazards.  ","Halbig, P., Stelzer, A.

The explanatory power of the empirical degree-day model constructed on the basis of LDT from field observations was 87.2%, similar to the 87.0% of a degree-day model based on laboratory data, suggesting that both models had similar explanatory power. Furthermore, the predictions of median date of emergence in both models were only five days earlier than the observed median date in 2011. These results show that the empirical phenology model based on field observations is a reliable method for predicting the phenology of insects.","Nam, Y. and Choi, W.

Survival and developmental period for the overwintered larvae and pupae were significantly influenced by temperature. Linear and nonlinear regression models quantitatively described temperature-dependent development and survival of T. japonensis. The survival models exhibited right-skewed bell shape patterns for all stages, indicating a more detrimental impact on survival at high temperatures. Theoretical optimum temperatures with highest survival were 22.3, 24.0 and 24.0�C for the overwintered larvae, pupae and total post-diapause development (the larvae to adults) respectively. Pupal mortality was higher at all temperatures than larval mortality and the suitable range of temperature for pupae was narrower than that of larvae. The nonlinear Briere model estimated that optimum temperatures with the fastest development were 29.1�C for larvae, 27.6�C for pupae and 27.0�C for larvae to adults.

Therefore current study aimed initially to estimate the thermal limits and requirements of TLM development. The obtained thermal limits and requirements were employed with interpolated temperature data from world climate database for mapping and forecasting spatial and temporal variations of those biological treats in Egyptian Agro-ecosystems under current and expected climatic changes scenarios of 2050. Upper and lower limit temperatures for TLM development are 7.6 and 35.4 °C, respectively, that it need 450.9 thermal units to complete life cycle. Medium temperature has negative significant effect on longevities of adults. Total immature stages period ranged between 21–34.9 days under current warm climatic conditions and it is expected to recede to 20.12—28.34 days in 2050. Despite the current thermal conditions of cold seasons can prolong it to 91.83 days in some provinces, expected thermal climatic conditions of 2050 will depress it to 57 days. It is expected that TLM existence will be restricted in north delta and western north cost governorates in warm seasons of 2050.

The aim was to determine the low temperature threshold as well as the thermal constant for egg, larval and pupal development. Time periods required by the insect to complete the various growth stages under three temperature conditions were studied. Pupae and adults of similar age were reared, in order to obtain sufficient eggs laid on tomato foliage during a single day. These were kept under controlled temperature. Larvae were fed fresh leaves kept in jars filled with water, and replaced as needed. Full-grown larvae were collected and transferred to glass vials containing pieces of corrugated cardboard to encourage pupation. Pupae were placed in Petri dishes a nd kept in rearing cages until adult emergence. The appearance of the different stages was registered daily. This information was used to calculate the thermal constant through the mean temperature method. Since the thermal constant is the same at different temperature conditions, three temperature thresholds were determined, for two temperatures at a time, and then averaged. The development of T. absoluta averaged 76.3 days at 14.0 deg C, 39.8 days at 19.7 deg C, and 23.8 days at 27.1 deg C. The lower threshold temperature from egg to adult was 8.14 deg C, for the egg stage averaged 6.9 deg C, for larval development 7.6 deg C and for pupae 9.2 deg C. The thermal constant for egg development was 103.8 deg D, for larval development 238.5 deg D and for pupal development 117.3 deg D; all of these add 459.6 deg D. This last amount of heat is close enough to that calculated directly for development from oviposition to adult emergence (453.6 deg D).

This study aimed to determine the relationship between temperature and the life history traits of T. absoluta and provide the thermal thresholds for development using life cycle modelling. Linear and non-linear models were fitted to life table data collected at five constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 �C, with Relative Humidity 70 � 5% and photoperiod 12L:12D.

A more holistic approach to the analysis of its thermal biology is essential background for developing models to assess its invasive potential. Our studies found that SATP has lower and upper thermal thresholds (θL = 5.37 °C and θU = 35.69 °C, respectively) than South American populations used in prior studies (θL = 7.38 °C and θU = 33.82 °C). Age-specific life tables were used to estimate the effects of temperature on its demographic parameters. Diapause in SATP had not been characterized prior to our study. We found facultative diapause in pupae developing from larvae exposed to relatively low temperatures (i.e., 2 and 5 °C) and short-day length for different exposure periods. The strength of diapause was measured as an increase in post-treatment developmental times of pupae (i.e., degree days) that on average were 2.45–3-fold greater than of pupae reared at favorable temperatures. A lower developmental threshold and a facultative diapause increase the invasive potential of SATP in temperate areas.

Degree-day requirements were found broadly to explain the relative distributions and differences in voltinism of A. urticae, P. c-album and I. io. The migrant V. atalanta did not fit into the predicted pattern, and this species may be more limited by its ability to overwinter. Although the most northerly distributed species, A. urticae, had the lowest degree-day requirement, it had the highest developmental threshold and performed best (for mortality, pupal weight and relative growth rate) at high experimental temperatures. It is suggested that this may be due to the gregarious nature of its larvae and their possible ability to thermoregulate. At southern margins, different distributional limits may be explained partly by larval gregariousness (a more northern trait) and maximum temperatures at which development is possible.

This study was conducted to investigate the basic ecology of B. depressa, and to develop a forecasting model for predicting the time of adult emergence in early season. In green pumpkin producing farms, the oviposition punctures caused by the oviposition of B. depressa occurred first between mid- and late July, peaked in late August, and then decreased in mid-September followed by disappearance of the symptoms in late September, during which oviposition activity of B. depressa is considered active. In full-ripened pumpkin producing farms, damaged fruits abruptly increased from early Auguest, because the decay of pumpkins caused by larval development began from that time. B. depressa produced a mean oviposition puncture of 2.2 per fruit and total 28.8-29.8 eggs per fruit. Adult emergence from overwintering pupae, which was monitored using a ground emergence trap, was first observed between mid- and late May, and peaked during late May to early June. The development times from overwintering pupae to adult emergence decreased with increasing temperature: 59.0 days at 15o C, 39.3 days at 20o C, 25.8 days at 25o C, and 21.4 days at 30o C. The pupae did not develop to adult at 35o C. The lower developmental threshold temperature was calculated as 6.8o C by linear regression. The thermal constant was 482.3 degree-days. The non-linear model of Gaussian equation well explained the relationship between the development rate and temperature. The Weibull function provided a good fit for the distribution of development times of overwintering pupae. The predicted date of 50% adult emergence by a degree-day model showed one day deviation from the observed actual date. Also, the output estimated by rate summation model, which was consisted of the developmental model and the Weibull function, well pursued the actual pattern of cumulative frequency curve of B. depressa adult emergence.

Optimum temperature (Topt) for immature development was estimated to be 21.60°C with the help of cubic polynomial non-linear equation. Furthermore, other models were also evaluated to check the accuracy of estimated thresholds and biological values of integral coefficients. Consequently, non-linear model was accepted and recommended for description of thermal-based development of Z. bicolorata.
